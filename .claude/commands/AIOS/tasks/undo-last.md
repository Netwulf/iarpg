When this command is used, execute the following task:

# Task: Undo Last Component Operation

**Task ID:** undo-last  
**Agent:** aios-developer  
**Version:** 1.0

## Description

Rollback the last component creation or modification operation. This task allows undoing recent changes made by the aios-developer agent, including single component creation, batch creation, or component updates.

## Context Required
- Access to transaction history
- File system permissions for affected files
- Manifest write permissions

## Prerequisites
- Transaction logging enabled
- Backup files available
- No conflicting operations since last transaction

## Input Requirements
- Optional: Transaction ID to rollback (defaults to last transaction)
- Optional: Selective rollback options

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Identify Transaction
Locate the most recent transaction or use provided transaction ID.

**Actions:**
- Query transaction history
- Display transaction details
- Confirm rollback intent

**Validation:**
- Transaction exists and is rollbackable
- User confirms the operation

### Step 2: Analyze Changes
Review all changes made in the transaction.

**Actions:**
- List all file operations
- Show manifest changes
- Display component metadata updates

**Output Format:**
```
Transaction: txn-1234567890-abcd
Type: component_creation
Date: 2025-01-31T10:30:00Z
Operations:
  - Created: /aios-core/agents/data-analyst.md
  - Updated: /aios-core/team-manifest.yaml
  - Created: /aios-core/tasks/analyze-data.md
```

### Step 3: Execute Rollback
Perform the rollback operation with proper error handling.

**Actions:**
- Restore file backups
- Revert manifest changes
- Update component metadata
- Clean up orphaned files

**Error Handling:**
- Handle missing backup files
- Manage partial rollback scenarios
- Report rollback failures

### Step 4: Verify Rollback
Ensure all changes have been properly reverted.

**Actions:**
- Verify file states
- Check manifest integrity
- Validate component consistency

**Success Criteria:**
- All files restored to previous state
- Manifest accurately reflects changes
- No orphaned references remain

## Output

### Success Response
```
✅ Rollback completed successfully!

Transaction: txn-1234567890-abcd
Rolled back:
  - ✓ Removed: data-analyst.md
  - ✓ Restored: team-manifest.yaml
  - ✓ Removed: analyze-data.md
  
Total operations: 3
Successful: 3
Failed: 0
```

### Failure Response
```
❌ Rollback partially failed

Transaction: txn-1234567890-abcd
Results:
  - ✓ Removed: data-analyst.md
  - ✗ Failed to restore: team-manifest.yaml (backup not found)
  - ✓ Removed: analyze-data.md

Please manually review and fix failed operations.
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
1. **Transaction Not Found**
   - Display available transactions
   - Suggest checking transaction ID

2. **Backup Files Missing**
   - Warn about incomplete rollback
   - Provide manual recovery steps

3. **Concurrent Modifications**
   - Detect file changes since transaction
   - Prompt for force rollback option

## Security Considerations
- Verify user has permission to rollback
- Prevent rollback of system transactions
- Maintain audit trail of rollback operations
- Validate file paths to prevent traversal

## Performance Notes
- Load only necessary transaction data
- Stream large backup files
- Batch file operations for efficiency

## Dependencies
- TransactionManager utility
- File system access
- Backup storage system

## Notes
- Rollback is only available for recent transactions (within retention period)
- Some operations may not be fully reversible
- Always creates a new transaction for the rollback itself
- Supports selective rollback for batch operations
