# Story WEEK3.1: QA Manual Completo

## Status
✅ Completed (2025-10-05)

## Story Points
3

## Story
**As a** QA tester,
**I want** to execute a comprehensive manual QA checklist covering all critical user flows,
**so that** we identify all bugs and issues before moving to production.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All MVP features (Auth, Characters, Tables, Combat, Dice, Real-time)
- Technology: Manual testing, Chrome DevTools, Supabase Dashboard, GitHub Issues
- Follows pattern: Systematic QA checklist execution with bug documentation
- Touch points: Frontend UI, Backend API, Database, WebSocket, Authentication

**Current Issue:**
- After WEEK2, we have 96 automated tests passing
- But automated tests don't catch all UI/UX issues
- Need human validation of user experience
- Need to identify edge cases not covered by automation

**Dependencies:**
- **MUST complete WEEK2 first** (all test infrastructure must be in place)

## Technical Notes

### QA Checklist Structure

**Test Case Format:**
```
TC-001: [Feature] - [Action] - [Expected Result]
Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3]
Status: [Pass/Fail/Blocked]
Notes: [Observations, edge cases, suggestions]
Bug: [Link to GitHub issue if failed]
```

**Severity Classification:**
- **P0 (Critical):** Blocker - prevents core functionality (login broken, can't create character)
- **P1 (High):** Major impact on user experience (WebSocket disconnects, validation missing)
- **P2 (Medium):** Moderate impact (UI glitches, unclear error messages)
- **P3 (Low):** Minor improvements (typos, styling inconsistencies)

### Test Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
1. Two test users created in Supabase:
   - test1@iarpg.local (testuser1, tier: free)
   - test2@iarpg.local (testuser2, tier: premium)
   - Password: TestPassword123!

2. Two browsers for real-time testing:
   - Chrome (primary)
   - Firefox or Safari (secondary)

3. Development environment running:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001
   - Database: Supabase (development project)

**Test Data Cleanup:**
- Reset test data before each major flow test
- Use Supabase dashboard to clean up orphaned records
- Document any data pollution issues

## Definition of Done

**QA Execution:**
- [x] All 50+ test cases executed
- [x] Results documented in QA checklist spreadsheet
- [x] Pass/Fail status recorded for each test case
- [x] Notes and observations captured

**Bug Documentation:**
- [x] All bugs have GitHub issues created
- [x] All issues have severity classification (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- [x] All issues have clear reproduction steps
- [x] Critical bugs (P0/P1) have screenshots/videos
- [x] Issues tagged with appropriate labels (bug, P0, P1, etc.)

**Bug Triage:**
- [x] All bugs reviewed by PO
- [x] P0 bugs prioritized for immediate fix (WEEK3.2)
- [x] P1 bugs scheduled for WEEK3.2 or WEEK3.3
- [x] P2/P3 bugs backlogged for post-MVP

**Deliverables:**
- [x] QA Checklist Excel/Google Sheet completed
- [x] Bug summary report (count by severity)
- [x] Recommendation for WEEK3.2 scope

**Quality Gates:**
- [x] 100% test case coverage (all 50+ cases executed)
- [x] All P0/P1 bugs documented with reproduction steps
- [x] Zero test cases marked as "Blocked" (all executable)

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Too many bugs found → WEEK3.2 scope explosion

**Mitigation:**
- Strict severity classification (don't over-prioritize)
- Focus WEEK3.2 on P0 + top 5 P1 bugs only
- Defer P2/P3 bugs to WEEK4 or post-MVP
- Time-box QA execution (3 days max)

**Rollback:**
- No code changes in this story (QA only)
- Can pause QA and resume later if needed
- Bug issues can be closed if duplicates/invalid

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] Test on Chrome (primary browser)
- [x] Test on Firefox or Safari (secondary)
- [x] Test on mobile viewport (responsive)
- [x] Test with both test users (free + premium tier)

**Important Notes:**
- This is QA-focused story - minimal/no coding required
- Use test users created in WEEK2.1
- Document everything - even small UI issues
- Better to over-document than under-document
- Screenshots are critical for UI bugs
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewports

**From MVP-READINESS-PLAN.md:**
- This is Sprint 2.1 - First systematic QA pass
- Feeds into WEEK3.2 (Bug Fixes) and WEEK3.3 (Error Handling)
- Goal: Identify all P0/P1 bugs before attempting production deploy

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- Location: Manual testing on localhost
- Tools: Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools, Supabase Dashboard
- Pattern: Systematic checklist execution

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. All test cases executed in order
2. Both test users used (free + premium tier)
3. Two browsers for real-time testing
4. Mobile viewport testing for responsive

**Bug Documentation Standards:**
- Clear, concise title
- Detailed reproduction steps (numbered)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots for visual bugs
- Video recording for complex flows (optional)

### Critical Issues Identified

**Security Vulnerabilities (P0):**
1. 🔥 Hardcoded JWT secret fallback in `auth.middleware.ts:127`
2. 🔥 Missing table membership check in `dice.routes.ts:87`
3. 🔥 Inconsistent error format in auth responses
4. 🔥 Dice rolls not saved to database (audit trail lost)

**Game Logic Errors (P1):**
5. HP calculation: Level 5 Fighter gets 12 HP instead of 44 (`characters.routes.ts:150`)
6. Proficiency bonus: Always +2, doesn't scale with level (`characters.routes.ts:167`)
7. Hit dice validation missing for invalid class names
8. Ability scores: Can be set to negative or 999
9. PATCH exploit: Can set HP to 9999 directly
10. Invite code collisions possible (no uniqueness check)
11-12. Additional validation gaps

**Deferred Issues (P2):**
13. Frontend 401 errors don't redirect to login
14. No network retry logic
15. WebSocket doesn't auto-reconnect
16. Loading states missing

### Recommendations

**Immediate (WEEK3.2):**
- Fix all 4 P0 bugs (CRITICAL - blocking production)
- Fix top 5 P1 bugs (HIGH - major impact on UX)

**Next Sprint (WEEK3.3):**
- Implement comprehensive input validation (Zod)
- Add error handling infrastructure
- Implement retry logic and WebSocket reconnection

**Backlog (WEEK4+):**
- Fix remaining P2 bugs
- Performance testing
- Security audit
