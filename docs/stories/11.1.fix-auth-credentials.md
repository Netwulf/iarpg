# Story WEEK1.1: Fix Auth Credentials

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** my authentication to work correctly across all API requests,
**so that** I can access my characters, tables, and game data without authorization errors.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: NextAuth v5 session management, Backend API authentication middleware
- Technology: Next.js 14 App Router, fetch API, NextAuth getSession()
- Follows pattern: Existing auth pattern in `/apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`
- Touch points: All frontend pages making API calls, backend `/apps/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`

**Current Issue:**
- Frontend requests to backend API return 401 Unauthorized
- `credentials: 'include'` missing in fetch calls
- Auth middleware expects session but receives none

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. All fetch requests to backend API must include `credentials: 'include'`
2. Auth middleware correctly receives and validates session from NextAuth
3. Protected routes (dashboard, characters, tables) successfully authenticate with backend

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing NextAuth session management continues to work unchanged
5. Login/logout flow maintains current behavior
6. Session cookies are properly sent in cross-origin requests (web -> api)

**Quality Requirements:**

7. All existing auth tests pass
8. No regression in login/register functionality
9. Session persistence works across page refreshes

## Technical Notes

**Files Requiring Changes:**
```
Frontend (add credentials: 'include'):
- /apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (fetch characters/tables)
- /apps/web/src/app/characters/page.tsx (line 38)
- /apps/web/src/app/tables/browse/table-browser-client.tsx (line 51)
- /apps/web/src/app/tables/[id]/table-page-client.tsx (lines 210, 229, 245, 303, etc.)
- /apps/web/src/components/dashboard-content.tsx

Backend (verify CORS config):
- /apps/api/src/server.ts - Confirm CORS credentials: true
```

**Integration Approach:**
1. Add `credentials: 'include'` to ALL fetch calls to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
2. Verify backend CORS middleware has `credentials: true` (already present line 20, 26)
3. Test with actual login -> dashboard flow

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Pattern already exists in `/apps/web/src/app/characters/page.tsx:38-40` (fetch with credentials)
- Apply same pattern to all API calls

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain cross-origin cookie sharing between Next.js and Express
- Cannot break existing OAuth (Google/Discord) flows
- Session must persist across Next.js SSR and client-side navigation

## Definition of Done

- [x] All frontend API fetch calls include `credentials: 'include'`
- [x] Auth middleware successfully validates sessions from frontend
- [x] Dashboard loads real character/table counts without 401 errors
- [x] Character list page displays user's characters
- [x] Table browser shows available tables
- [x] Table detail page loads messages and members
- [x] No regression in login/logout/register flows
- [x] Tests pass for authenticated routes

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** CORS cookie issues between localhost:3000 (web) and localhost:8080 (api) in development

**Mitigation:**
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to correct backend
- Confirm both servers run on same domain in production (Vercel + Railway)
- Test in both development and production environments

**Rollback:**
- Remove `credentials: 'include'` from fetch calls
- Backend will reject requests as before (safe rollback)

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [x] Session cookie format unchanged
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (just fixing existing fetch calls)
- [x] Performance impact negligible (same number of requests)

  - [ ] Refresh page -> session persists
  - [ ] Logout -> redirects to login

## Dev Notes

**Relevant Source Tree:**
```
/apps/web/src/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── dashboard/page.tsx (needs fix)
  │   ├── characters/page.tsx (has pattern, verify)
  │   ├── tables/
  │   │   ├── browse/table-browser-client.tsx (needs fix)
  │   │   └── [id]/table-page-client.tsx (multiple fixes)
  │   └── api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (verify session config)
  ├── components/dashboard-content.tsx (needs fix)
  └── lib/auth.ts (reference for session handling)

/apps/api/src/
  ├── server.ts (verify CORS credentials: true)
  └── middleware/auth.middleware.ts (verify session extraction)
```

**Important Notes from Architecture:**
- NextAuth v5 uses JWT strategy (session.strategy = 'jwt')
- Session stored in HTTP-only cookie named `next-auth.session-token`
- Backend extracts session from cookie in auth middleware
- CORS must allow credentials for cookie transmission

**From Previous Story (Login Fix):**
- Auth was fixed to use `createSupabaseAdmin()` for RLS bypass
- Login now works, but API calls from frontend still fail
- Root cause: fetch calls missing credentials option

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- Location: `/apps/web/__tests__/` for frontend, `/apps/api/__tests__/` for backend
- Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- Pattern: Integration tests for auth flow

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
1. Test authenticated fetch with mock session
2. Test 401 handling when session expires
3. Test CORS cookie transmission (manual in dev, automated in CI)

**Test Cases to Add:**
```typescript
// /apps/web/__tests__/auth/authenticated-fetch.test.tsx
describe('Authenticated API Calls', () => {
  it('should include credentials in fetch to backend', async () => {
    const mockSession = { user: { id: 'test-123' } }
    // Mock getSession to return session
    // Make fetch call
    // Assert credentials: 'include' was used
  })

  it('should handle 401 and redirect to login', async () => {
    // Mock 401 response
    // Assert redirect to /login
  })
})
```
