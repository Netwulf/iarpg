---

- [x] All stories marked as "Complete"
- [x] QA checklist created
- [ ] Automated tests passing
- [ ] Database migration ready

---

## üóÑÔ∏è STEP 1: RUN DATABASE MIGRATION (CRITICAL)

### Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `iarpg-deploy`

2. **Go to SQL Editor**
   - Sidebar ‚Üí "SQL Editor"
   - Click "+ New query"

3. **Copy Migration SQL**
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire file content
   cat packages/db/supabase/migrations/20250104000000_create_missing_tables.sql
   ```

4. **Execute Migration**
   - Paste SQL into editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd+Enter
   - Wait for success message

5. **Verify Tables Created**
   ```sql
   -- Run this to verify
   SELECT table_name
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public'
   AND table_name IN ('ai_usage', 'async_turns', 'subscriptions', 'campaign_logs');

   -- Should return 4 rows
   ```

6. **Check RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Verify RLS enabled
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
   FROM pg_tables
   WHERE schemaname = 'public'
   AND tablename IN ('ai_usage', 'async_turns', 'subscriptions', 'campaign_logs');

   -- All should have rowsecurity = true
   ```

### Option B: Via Supabase CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not installed
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# Login
supabase login

# Link to project
cd /Users/taypuri/iarpg-deploy
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Run migration
supabase db push

# Verify
supabase db diff
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

- **DO NOT skip this step** - Without these tables, Week 2 features will break
- **Migration is idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- **Backup recommended** - Take snapshot before running (Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Backups)

---

## üß™ STEP 2: RUN AUTOMATED TESTS

### 2.1: Install Test Dependencies

```bash
cd apps/web

# Install testing libraries if not present
pnpm add -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 2.2: Configure Jest

Create `apps/web/jest.config.js`:

```javascript
const nextJest = require('next/jest');

const createJestConfig = nextJest({
  dir: './',
});

const customJestConfig = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
  },
  testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts', '**/__tests__/**/*.test.tsx'],
};

module.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig);
```

Create `apps/web/jest.setup.js`:

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

### 2.3: Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suite
pnpm test auth/credentials.test.tsx
pnpm test dashboard/real-data.test.tsx
pnpm test tables/browser-api.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

### Expected Results

```
PASS  __tests__/auth/credentials.test.tsx
  ‚úì includes credentials in character API fetch
  ‚úì includes credentials in tables API fetch
  ‚úì makes parallel API calls with credentials
  ‚úì handles 401 errors gracefully

PASS  __tests__/dashboard/real-data.test.tsx
  ‚úì displays actual character and table counts
  ‚úì shows loading state initially
  ‚úì handles zero characters gracefully
  ‚úì displays error message on fetch failure
  ‚úì retries fetch on error when retry button clicked
  ‚úì calculates active tables correctly

PASS  __tests__/tables/browser-api.test.tsx
  ‚úì fetches and displays tables from API on mount
  ‚úì includes search filter in API query
  ‚úì includes play style filters in API query
  ‚úì handles multiple play style filters
  ‚úì displays pagination controls
  ‚úì navigates to next page on pagination click
  ‚úì clears all filters when clear button clicked
  ‚úì shows empty state when no tables found
  ‚úì shows loading state initially
  ‚úì handles fetch errors gracefully
  ‚úì resets to page 1 when filters change

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       21 passed, 21 total
```

## üì¶ STEP 3: DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

### 3.1: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd /Users/taypuri/iarpg-deploy

# Verify status
git status

# Should show: "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits"

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Verify push succeeded
git log --oneline -3
```

### 3.2: Verify Vercel Auto-Deploy

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find project: `iarpg-web`
   - Should see deployment in progress

2. **Monitor Build Logs**
   - Click on deployment
   - Watch build progress
   - Check for errors

3. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Typical time: 2-5 minutes
   - Status should change to "Ready"

4. **Note Deployment URL**
   ```
   Production: https://iarpg-web.vercel.app
   Preview: https://iarpg-web-git-main-[your-team].vercel.app
   ```

### 3.3: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```bash
# Frontend (Vercel ‚Üí iarpg-web ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://iarpg-api.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://iarpg-web.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[your-secret]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[your-supabase-url]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]

# Backend (Railway ‚Üí iarpg-api ‚Üí Variables)
DATABASE_URL=[supabase-connection-string]
CORS_ORIGIN=https://iarpg-web.vercel.app
PORT=8080
```

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN (If Issues Found)

### Critical Issues Found During Deployment

If you encounter blocking issues:

#### Option 1: Revert Code
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD

# Push revert
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy previous version
```

#### Option 2: Rollback Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ai_usage CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS async_turns CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subscriptions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS campaign_logs CASCADE;
```

#### Option 3: Disable Features
- Remove SocketProvider from layout (disable WebSocket)
- Revert dashboard to hardcoded "0"s
- Re-comment table browser API call
