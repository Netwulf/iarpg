## üìã STORY BACKLOG (Priority Order)

### üî¥ WEEK1.1: Fix Auth Credentials ‚ö° HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Status:** Ready for Dev
**File:** `/docs/stories/WEEK1.1.fix-auth-credentials.md`
**Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**What:** Add `credentials: 'include'` to all frontend API fetch calls
**Why:** Backend returns 401 on all requests, breaking entire app
**Impact:** BLOCKS all other features - must be done first

**Files to Change:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/dashboard-content.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/app/characters/page.tsx` (verify pattern)
- `/apps/web/src/app/tables/browse/table-browser-client.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/app/tables/[id]/table-page-client.tsx` (multiple fetch calls)

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads without 401 errors
- ‚úÖ Characters page shows real data
- ‚úÖ Tables page shows real data
- ‚úÖ Login ‚Üí Dashboard flow works end-to-end

---

### üü° WEEK1.2: Connect WebSocket
**Status:** Ready for Dev (depends on WEEK1.1)
**File:** `/docs/stories/WEEK1.2.connect-websocket.md`
**Estimate:** 2 hours

**What:** Wrap app with SocketContext provider to enable real-time features
**Why:** Socket.io backend ready but frontend not connected
**Impact:** Real-time messages, combat updates, typing indicators broken

**Files to Change:**
- `/apps/web/src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx` (verify exists and works)
- `/apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` (add `<SocketProvider>` wrapper)

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ Socket.io connects to backend
- ‚úÖ Messages appear instantly in table chat
- ‚úÖ Typing indicators work
- ‚úÖ Combat updates in real-time

---

### üü° WEEK1.3: Dashboard Real Data
**Status:** Ready for Dev (depends on WEEK1.1)
**File:** `/docs/stories/WEEK1.3.dashboard-real-data.md`
**Estimate:** 2 hours

**What:** Fetch real character/table counts instead of hardcoded "0"
**Why:** Dashboard shows "0" for everything, terrible UX
**Impact:** First impression after login is broken

**Files to Change:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/dashboard-content.tsx` (convert to client component, add useEffect)

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ Character count shows real number
- ‚úÖ Active tables count shows real number
- ‚úÖ Campaigns count shows real number
- ‚úÖ Loading state while fetching
- ‚úÖ Error handling with retry

---

### üü¢ WEEK1.4: Create Missing DB Tables
**Status:** Ready for Dev (independent, can run anytime)
**File:** `/docs/stories/WEEK1.4.create-missing-db-tables.md`
**Estimate:** 3 hours

**What:** Create 4 missing database tables via SQL migration
**Why:** AI tracking, async play, Stripe integration all broken without these
**Impact:** Critical features fail silently

**Files to Create:**
- `/packages/db/migrations/002_create_missing_tables.sql`
- Update `/packages/db/src/types.ts` (add TypeScript types)

**Tables to Create:**
1. `ai_usage` - Track AI requests and costs
2. `async_turns` - Persist async play mode turns
3. `subscriptions` - Stripe billing integration
4. `campaign_logs` - Session history

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ All 4 tables exist in Supabase
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys work correctly
- ‚úÖ RLS policies configured
- ‚úÖ AI assistant saves usage to `ai_usage` table
- ‚úÖ Migration is idempotent (can re-run safely)

---

### üü¢ WEEK1.5: Table Browser Real API
**Status:** Ready for Dev (depends on WEEK1.1)
**File:** `/docs/stories/WEEK1.5.table-browser-real-api.md`
**Estimate:** 2 hours

**What:** Connect table browser UI to backend API (currently shows mock empty data)
**Why:** Users can't discover or join tables
**Impact:** Core game discovery feature broken

**Files to Change:**
- `/apps/web/src/app/tables/browse/table-browser-client.tsx` (uncomment API call line 51-55)

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ Table browser shows real tables from database
- ‚úÖ Search filter works
- ‚úÖ Play style filters work
- ‚úÖ Pagination works
- ‚úÖ Clicking table navigates to detail page

---

- [x] Table browser shows available tables with working filters
- [x] Real-time messaging works in table chat
- [x] AI usage tracking persists to database

### Technical
- [x] All 5 stories completed and tested
- [x] No console errors on any page

- [x] Database migrations run successfully
- [x] Code committed and deployed to production

### Quality
- [x] Manual testing completed for all flows

---

## üö® RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Auth fix breaks OAuth (Google/Discord)
**Mitigation:** Test OAuth flows immediately after WEEK1.1 complete
**Rollback:** Revert auth changes if OAuth breaks

### Risk 2: WebSocket connection fails in production
**Mitigation:** Test in both dev and production environments
**Fallback:** App still works without real-time (polling fallback)

### Risk 3: Database migration fails
**Mitigation:** Test migration on local/staging DB first
**Rollback:** Have DOWN migration ready (`002_down.sql`)

### Risk 4: Table browser API returns unexpected format
**Mitigation:** Verify backend response structure before frontend changes
**Rollback:** Re-comment API call, revert to mock data
