# Meeting Best Practices Knowledge Base

## 1. Meeting Planning

### When to Hold a Meeting

**Good Reasons for Meetings:**
- Complex decisions requiring discussion
- Brainstorming and creative collaboration
- Team alignment and relationship building
- Conflict resolution
- Important announcements requiring immediate feedback

**Better Handled Asynchronously:**
- Simple status updates
- Information sharing without discussion
- One-way announcements
- Tasks that can be done individually

### Meeting Types

1. **Standup/Check-in** (15 minutes)
   - Daily team sync
   - Quick updates on progress and blockers

2. **Planning Meetings** (1-2 hours)
   - Sprint planning
   - Project kickoffs
   - Quarterly planning

3. **Decision Meetings** (30-60 minutes)
   - Focused on making specific decisions
   - Limited attendees with decision authority

4. **Brainstorming** (45-90 minutes)
   - Creative exploration
   - Problem-solving
   - Innovation sessions

5. **Retrospectives** (60-90 minutes)
   - Reflect on past work
   - Identify improvements
   - Team learning

## 2. Effective Agendas

### Agenda Structure

```markdown

**Date:** [Date]
**Time:** [Start - End]
**Location:** [Location/Link]

## Objectives
[Clear statement of what meeting aims to achieve]

## Agenda Items
1. **Topic 1** (10 mins) - [Owner]
   - Key points to discuss
   - Desired outcome

2. **Topic 2** (20 mins) - [Owner]

```

### Time Management Tips

- Allocate specific time to each agenda item

- End with time for questions

## 3. Note-Taking Best Practices

### What to Capture

**Always Document:**
- Decisions made and rationale
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Key discussion points
- Attendance

**Optionally Document:**
- Detailed discussion notes
- Different viewpoints raised
- Questions that need follow-up
- Context for future reference

### Note-Taking Methods

2. **Mind Mapping**
   - Visual representation of topics
   - Shows relationships between ideas
   - Good for brainstorming sessions

3. **Outline Method**
   - Hierarchical structure
   - Topics and subtopics
   - Good for structured meetings

## 4. Action Item Management

### SMART Action Items

- **Specific**: Clearly defined task
- **Measurable**: Clear completion criteria
- **Assignable**: Single owner (not a team)
- **Realistic**: Achievable with available resources
- **Time-bound**: Has a deadline

### Example Action Items

❌ Poor: "Team should improve documentation"
✅ Good: "Alex to update API documentation sections 3-5 by Friday Oct 6"

❌ Poor: "Look into performance issues"
✅ Good: "Sarah to profile database queries and report findings by Tuesday Oct 3"

### Tracking Action Items

- Use consistent format
- Review at start of each meeting
- Flag overdue items
- Close completed items explicitly

## 5. Decision Documentation

### Decision Template

```markdown
**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Made by:** [Who made the decision]
**Date:** [When]
**Rationale:** [Why this decision was made]
**Alternatives Considered:** [Other options discussed]
**Impact:** [Expected effects of this decision]
**Next Steps:** [What happens now]
```

### Types of Decisions

1. **Unanimous** - Everyone agrees
2. **Majority** - Most agree, documented dissent
3. **Delegated** - Authority makes decision after input
4. **Deferred** - Needs more information/time

## 6. Meeting Facilitation
